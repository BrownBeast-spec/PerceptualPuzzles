Designing Perceptual Puzzles by Differentiating Probabilistic Programs
Objective

This repository aims to create new visual illusions by utilizing probabilistic programming models. These models are designed to mimic and analyze human visual perception, allowing us to generate adversarial examples and visual illusions that challenge our perception of reality.
Key Concepts
1. Probabilistic Models of Perception

    Bayesian Inference: Human vision is modeled as a Bayesian inference process, where the brain uses prior knowledge to interpret visual inputs.
    Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC): MCMC sampling is used to approximate the posterior distribution of visual scenes based on the stimuli.

2. Differentiable Probabilistic Programming Language (PPL)

    Differentiation through Inference: This project leverages a differentiable probabilistic programming language (PPL), enabling automatic differentiation through the inference process.
    Gradient Descent Optimization: Using gradient descent, the program generates illusions that fool probabilistic models of perception.

3. Adversarial Examples

    Adversarial Visual Inputs: These are intentionally designed inputs that cause models of perception to make incorrect or unexpected inferences.

4. Inverse Inverse Rendering

    Purpose: This method searches for images that cause incorrect scene interpretation by the model, leading to perceptual puzzles and illusions.
